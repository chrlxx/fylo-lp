## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Here's our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) to help you do that.
2. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.

## Giving feedback
